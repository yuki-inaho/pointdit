PointDiT is a minimalist pixel-space Diffusion Transformer for monocular geometry estimation. It is a plain ViT that denoises raw 3D point map patches directly, conditioned on image tokens from a frozen pre-trained DINOv3: no point map tokenizer, no latent diffusion, no hybrid architecture, and no intricate loss formulation.

## Installation

This codebase is developed with Python 3.12, PyTorch 2.7.0, and CUDA 12.8.

We recommend setting up a virtual environment (e.g., [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)) before installation:

```bash
# conda
conda create -y -n pointdit python=3.12
conda activate pointdit

# or venv
# python -m venv /path/to/venv/pointdit
# source /path/to/venv/pointdit/bin/activate

# torch 2.7.0, cuda 12.8
pip install torch==2.7.0 torchvision==0.22.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

pip install -r requirements.txt

# DINOv3 encoder code (not vendored; built with torch.hub from a local checkout)
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov3.git third_party/dinov3
```

All commands are run from the repository root, and the launch scripts in [scripts/](scripts).

The DINOv3 weights are gated and cannot be redistributed, so they are not part of the released
checkpoints. Request access on the
[official DINOv3 repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov3) and place the weights
under `pretrained/dinov3/` with their exact upstream filenames, or point `DINOV3_WEIGHTS_DIR` at
the directory holding them. They are needed for evaluation and the demo as well as for training;
see [MODELS.md](MODELS.md) for the file list.

## Model Zoo

Pre-trained models are available in the [Model Zoo](MODELS.md), at `256×256` and `512×512` for
each of PointDiT-B / L / H. All weights are hosted on
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/haofeixu/pointdit).

Download the weights and place (or symlink) them in the `pretrained` directory:

```bash
ln -s YOUR_MODEL_PATH pretrained
```

The checkpoints ship without the frozen DINOv3 encoder, which is downloaded separately (see
[Installation](#installation)).

## Demo

Check [scripts/demo_l_512.sh](scripts/demo_l_512.sh) for running our pre-trained models on your own images, with no ground truth and no camera intrinsics required. Set `IMAGE_DIR` at the top of the script and run it:

```bash
bash scripts/demo_l_512.sh
```

Any `.jpg`/`.png` files work, and nested folders are fine, since the loader globs recursively. Results are written to `generation/`.


## Dataset Preparation

See [DATASETS.md](DATASETS.md) for detailed instructions on preparing the 12 training datasets and the 7 zero-shot evaluation datasets. We have provided the download link for the 7 evaluation datasets in [DATASETS.md](DATASETS.md).

Symlink the prepared datasets to the `datasets` directory:

```bash
ln -s YOUR_DATASET_PATH datasets
```

Point clouds are never stored on disk: the training loader reads `(RGB, depth, intrinsics)` and back-projects on the fly.


## Evaluation

Evaluation scripts are also provided in [scripts/](scripts) for reproducing the results in our paper:

```bash
bash scripts/eval_l_512.sh
```

Swap `l` for `b` or `h`, and `512` for `256`. Each script's header comment lists the numbers it should reproduce.

## Training

PointDiT is trained in two stages: (1) `256×256` pre-training on SceneNet-RGBD and (2) `512×512` fine-tuning on the 11-dataset mixture.

```bash
bash scripts/train_stage1_256_b.sh
bash scripts/train_stage2_512_b.sh
```

The training scripts in [scripts/](scripts) contain the exact commands and hyperparameters used for the experiments in our paper. Please refer to them for detailed configurations. Before training, you need to download the DINOv3 weights (see [Installation](#installation)) and prepare the datasets per [DATASETS.md](DATASETS.md).


## RGB-D point clouds

`util/rgbd_pointcloud.py` back-projects a registered RGB-D pair (RGB image +
metric depth map + pinhole intrinsics) into a colored point cloud and exports it
as a binary or ASCII PLY file. Depth can be a float array in meters or an
integer map scaled by `--depth-scale` (for example `0.001` for 16-bit PNGs in
millimeters); optional min/max depth clipping, a validity mask, voxel
downsampling and a camera-to-world `--extrinsics` matrix are supported.

The `pixi` environment provides the light-weight dependencies of this path
(`numpy`, `imageio`, `pyyaml`, `trimesh`); PyTorch is not needed:

```bash
pixi install --all
pixi run -e dev test
pixi run rgbd-to-ply -- --rgb rgb.png --depth depth.png \
  --intrinsics intrinsics.json --depth-scale 0.001 --min-depth 0.2 --max-depth 3.0 \
  --output cloud.ply
```

`--extrinsics` expects a camera-to-world matrix (`.npy`/`.json`, 4x4 or 3x4) and
`--flip-yz` converts the output to the Y-up/Z-out convention used by
`util/viz_pointcloud.py`. Intrinsics files can hold a 3x3 matrix, a flat list of
9 values, or an `fx`/`fy`/`cx`/`cy` mapping.
